## Introduction to Application

In this project, the main function of the project is to provide a movie display page. The sorting and search functions are available on this interface and the user can sort the interface according to their needs based on elements such as popularity, rating etc. The application also allows the user to search by keywords. When the user clicks on a film poster, they can be redirected to the film's details page, where they can click on a button to mark the film as seen, or click on a button to go to youtube to see the film's trailer. Once the film has been marked as seen, the film's poster can then be seen on the millstone page.
